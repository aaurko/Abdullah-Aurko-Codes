# Abdullah-Aurko-Codes

This is a list of codes that I worked on, wrote and implemented in my time as an Applied Math PhD student and researcher at Florida State University. I have graduated with my PhD form FSU in July 2023. Please feel free to reach out to me at: aaurko@math.fsu.edu if you have further questions.
